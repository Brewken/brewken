/**
 * \brief An instance of this class holds information about a particular JSON encoding (eg BeerJSON 2.1).  Specifically,
 *        that information includes:
 *          • the corresponding \c JsonSchema that we use to validate a JSON document
 *          • the \c JsonRecordDefinition objects that define how we map BeerJSON objects to our own data structures.
 *
 *        As we are parsing or creating a JSON document, we'll create a \c JsonRecord for each record we are reading /
 *        writing, using the relevant \c JsonRecordDefinition as a template.
 *
 *        Similar to xml/XmlCoding.h
