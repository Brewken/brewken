/**
 * \brief This class and its derived classes represent a record in an XML document.  See comment in xml/XmlCoding.h for
 *        more detail.
 *
 *        Note that one structural difference between \c XmlRecord and \c JsonRecord is that, in the former we only pass
 *        underlying (ie Xalan) record data in when we are reading from XML, not when we are writing, so the parameter
 *        is on the \c load function, not the constructor.  Maybe one day we could rejig the XML so it works more like
 *        the Json code, or, more likely, we'll just leave it alone once everything is working.
