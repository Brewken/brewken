/**
 * \class EditorBase
 *
 * \brief As in other places where we want to use class templating, we have to use multiple inheritance because we can't
 *        template a class that ultimately inherits from \c QObject.  However, with the magic of the Curiously Recurring
 *        Template Pattern, we can get past some of the limitations and avoid too much copy-and-paste code duplication.
 *        Eg:
 *
 *              QObject     Ui::hopEditor
 *                   \           |
 *                   ...         |
 *                     \         |     EditorBase<Hop, HopEditor>
 *                     QDialog   |    /
 *                           \   |   /
 *                            \  |  /
 *                          HopEditor
 *
 *        Besides inheriting from \c QDialog, the derived class (eg \c HopEditor in the example above) needs to
 *        implement the following trivial slots:
 *
 *          - \c void \c save() public slot, which should call \c EditorBase::doSave
 *          - \c void \c clearAndClose() public slot, which should call \c EditorBase::doClearAndClose
 *          - \c void \c changed(\c QMetaProperty, \c QVariant) public slot, which should call \c EditorBase::doChanged
 *          - \c void \c clickedNew() public slot, which should call \c EditorBase::newEditItem
 *
 *        The code for the definition of these slot functions (which is "the same" for all editors) can be inserted in
 *        the implementation file using the EDITOR_COMMON_SLOT_DEFINITIONS macro.  Eg, in HopEditor, we need:
 *
 *          EDITOR_COMMON_SLOT_DEFINITIONS(HopEditor)
 *
 *        Note that we cannot do the equivalent for the header file declarations because the Qt MOC does not expand
 *        non-Qt macros.
 *
 *        The derived class also needs to implement the following substantive member functions that \c EditorBase will
 *        call:
 *          - \c void \c writeFieldsToEditItem -- Writes most fields from the editor GUI fields into the object being
 *                                                edited
 *          - \c void \c writeLateFieldsToEditItem -- Writes any fields that must wait until the object definitely
 *                                                    exists in the DB
 *          - \c void \c readFieldsFromEditItem -- (Re)read one or all fields from the object into the relevant GUI
 *                                                 field(s).
