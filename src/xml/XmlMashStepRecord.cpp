   // There are a couple of extra things to check/fix on MashStep objects we are reading in.
   //
   // (1) Per the notes in beerxml/v1/BeerXml.xsd, one thing we can't currently check via XML XSD is the restriction
   // that it doesn't make sense to have infuseAmount_l set to anything other than 0 (the default) if thy type of step
   // is a Decoction (which doesn't involve infusing, ie adding, water).  However, now that only have one amount field,
   // not two (one for infusion and another for decoction), I'm not going to worry too much about enforcing this on
   // input.
   //
   // (2) Despite what one might infer from the constructor signatures, every MashStep is, in theory, supposed to have a
   // name.  (It does after all inherit from NamedEntity.)  However, at least some versions of Brewken have allowed
   // creation and export of recipes with one or more unnamed MashSteps.  Moreover, the BeerXML 1.0 standard only says
   // the NAME tag has to be present, not that it can't be empty.  (We might wish that the standard had been more
   // explicit about such things, but it is what it is.)
   //
   // MashStep names of are certainly not expected to be globally unique, and are usually simply descriptive of what
   // the step is (eg "Mash In", "Mash Out", "Conversion", "Final Batch Sparge").
   //
   // Therefore, if only a blank name was supplied in the XML, we will amend this to "Unnamed Mash Step" (or whatever
   // that translates to in your language).
