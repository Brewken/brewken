      // Hop/Fermentable/etc in question.  The same is true for addition times for Hops.
      //
      // When we add something to a Recipe, typically a copy is made so that we have a Hop/Fermentable/etc that is not
      // shared with any other Recipes and thus there is no ambiguity about storing the amount in it.
      //
      // However, when we read in from BeerXML, we try to avoid creating unnecessary duplicates of things.  If there's

      // for the sake of it.  This is the right thing to do if we're reading in Hops outside the context of a Recipe.
      // But if the hop in the BeerXML file was inside a Recipe record, then we we need to make sure we captured the
      // "how much and when to add" info inside that hop record.
