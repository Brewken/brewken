/**
 * \brief This class extends QString to allow you to construct Qt QStrings from Xerces or Xalan strings without having
 *        to do lots of reinterpret_cast.
 *
 * Xerces and Qt both represent strings internally using UTF-16.  However, Xerces uses a base type (uint16_t) to define
 * its 16-bit chars (XMLCh), whereas Qt uses a small class (QChar) for the same data.  So we need a reinterpret_cast to
 * switch between the two.  This is preferable to using the Xerces built-in string handling, which is a bit clunky: you
 * either have to create fixed-sized arrays of XMLCh and call xercesc::XMLString::transcode() to fill them from a
 * char * source, or manually declare constant strings as null-terminated arrays, eg
 *   XMLCh features[] {xercesc::chLatin_L, xercesc::chLatin_S, xercesc::chNull};
 *
 * Xalan works pretty much the same way as Xerces, but has its own definitions (XalanDOMChar is the same as XMLCh) and
 * a proper string class (xalanc::XalanDOMString).
