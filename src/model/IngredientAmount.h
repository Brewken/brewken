/**
 * \brief Represents an amount of an ingredient.  These amounts are used in two places: in the \c RecipeAddition
 *        subclasses for the amount of an ingredient being added to a \c Recipe; and in the \c Inventory subclasses for
 *        the amount of an ingredient held in stock.
 *
 *        In our model, different types of ingredients are allowed to be measured in different ways:
 *
 *           \c Salt can be measured only by mass
 *           \c Water can be measured only by volume
 *           \c Fermentable and \c Hop can be measured either by mass or by volume
 *           \c Misc and \c Yeast can be measured by mass, by volume or by count
 *
 *        Typically, for things that can be measured more than one way, it is the individual instance of a class that
 *        determines the measurement.  Eg, a \c Hop would be measured by mass if it is leaves, pellets or powder, but by
 *        volume if it is an extract.  For other things, there isn't a rule, and it's a case-by-case decision for the
 *        brewer.   Eg, for dry \c Yeast it's the brewer's choice to measure by packets or mass.  For \c Misc, it might
 *        even vary by recipe as to whether you're adding, say, half an apple or 500 grams of apple.
 *
 *        So, for, ingredient types where we allow choice of how-to-measure, we pick a sensible default and let the user
 *        change it where needed.
 *
 *        Classes inheriting from this one, should place the \c INGREDIENT_AMOUNT_DECL macro in their header class
 *        declaration (eg immediately (typically on the line after after the \c Q_OBJECT macro), and the
 *        \c INGREDIENT_AMOUNT_COMMON_CODE macro in their .cpp file.  They also need the following lines in their class
 *        declaration:
 *
 *              //! \brief The amount in kilograms, liters or count (ie "number of ...") -- see \c IngredientAmount
 *              Q_PROPERTY(double quantity                READ quantity    WRITE setQuantity)
 *              //! \brief Whether we are measuring in kilograms, liters or count (ie "number of ...") -- see \c IngredientAmount
 *              Q_PROPERTY(Ingredient::Measure measure    READ measure     WRITE setMeasure )
 *
 *
 *        (We cannot insert these lines with the \c INGREDIENT_AMOUNT_DECL macro because the Qt Meta Object Compiler aka
 *        MOC does not expand macros.)
 *
 *        ADDITIONALLY, it is necessary in the class declaration of the corresponding ingredient (eg in Hop.h for hops)
 *        to add publicly accessible:
 *           static constexpr Ingredient::Measures validMeasures = ...
 *           static constexpr Ingredient::Measure defaultMeasure = ...
 *
 *        ---
 *
 *        Because this class is essentially just adding a couple of fields to its "owner" (eg \c RecipeAdditionHop,
 *        \c InventoryHop), it doesn't merit being a full-fledged \c NamedEntity with its own separate database table.
 *        Nonetheless, we do want the fields of this class to be stored in the database(!) but just as extra columns on
 *        the tables used by the "owner" classes.  And we want to be able to take advantage of utility functions such as
 *        \c NamedEntity::setAndNotify().  Using the Curiously Recurring Template (CRTP) pattern allows us to piggy-back
 *        the fields of this class onto the "owner" class at the cost of some slight ugliness/complexity in the code,
 *        which we mostly hide from the "owner" class with macros.
 *
 *
 * TBD: With a bit more refactoring, we could perhaps align this class more closely with \c Measurement::Amount
