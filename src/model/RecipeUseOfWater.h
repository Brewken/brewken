/**
 * \brief Records the amount of \c Water used in a \c Recipe
 *
 *        This has some similarities with \c RecipeAddition and its derived classes, but rather less information is
 *        stored for water additions, so it's a separate class.  Also, \c Water is \b not an \c Ingredient (because we
 *        do not hold inventory of it).
 *
 *        We could almost have done without this class and just had a \c Recipe directly refer to the \c Water it uses.
 *        However, \b technically, both BeerJSON and BeerXML allow for multiple different waters to be added to a
 *        recipe, so we align with that.
