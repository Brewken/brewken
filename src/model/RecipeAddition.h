/**
 * \brief Common base class for recipe addition classes: \c RecipeAdditionHop, \c RecipeAdditionFermentable,
 *        \c RecipeAdditionMisc and \c RecipeAdditionYeast.
 *
 *        This follows the corresponding BeerJSON \c HopAdditionType, \c FermentableAdditionType, etc types.  (However,
 *        note that we do \b not have a class corresponding with BeerJSON's \c WaterAdditionType as it's simpler just to
 *        include the two component fields directly in \c Recipe.)
 *
 *        In BeerJSON, the inheritance structure of, eg, hop-related records is:
 *
 *                                         HopVarietyBase
 *                                            /     \
 *                                           /       \
 *                           VarietyInformation     HopAdditionType
 *
 *        And RecipeType->ingredients->hop_additions is an array of HopAdditionType (which adds amount and timing info
 *        to HopVarietyBase).
 *
 *        HOWEVER, this is not the right structure for us.  The objective in BeerJSON is that a RecipeType record should
 *        contain a "minimal collection of the description of ingredients, procedures and other required parameters
 *        necessary to recreate a batch of beer".  Thus its HopAdditionType needs to give enough information about a hop
 *        for the recipe to be usable even if the software reading the record does not already have a record for that
 *        hop.
 *
 *        For our purposes, we want a \c RecipeAdditionHop to have the timing and quantity info of BeerJSON's
 *        HopAdditionType, but not to duplicate information that is already in \c Hop.
 *
 *        In the long run, we'd like to distinguish between generic information about a particular hop variety (eg
 *        Fuggle) and specific information about a particular batch of that hop (eg Xyz supplier's 2022 harvest pellets
 *        with 4.4% alpha acid).  This is, however, outside the scope of the BeerJSON work, and will be something we
 *        come back to as a future enhancement.  In the meantime, we have:
 *
 *                     NamedEntity
 *                     /    |     \
 *                    /     |      \
 *           Ingredient   Recipe   RecipeAddition     IngredientAmount<RecipeAdditionHop, Hop>
 *               |                       \            /
 *               |                        \          /
 *              Hop                   RecipeAdditionHop
