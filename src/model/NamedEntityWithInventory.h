/**
 * \class NamedEntityWithInventory  TODO This is replaced (soon) with \c Ingredient
 *
 * \brief Extends \c NamedEntity to provide functionality for storing in Inventory
 *
 *        .:TBD:. Should we combine with amount?  But what about Salt?
 *
 *        We have two places we need to measure things: inventory and recipe additions.  Measurements are:
 *
 *           - By volume for water
 *           - By mass or volume for Fermentable, Hop
 *           - By mass, volume or count for Misc, Yeast
 *
 *           - By mass for salt, though NB BeerJSON does not support salt
 *
 * Running out of names for things as we already used Amount, Quantity.  IngredientAmount
