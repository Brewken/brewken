 * \class NamedEntity
 *
 * \brief The base class for our substantive storable items.  There are really two sorts of storable items: ones that
 *        are freestanding and ones that are owned by other storable items.  Eg, a Hop exists in its own right and may
 *        or may not be used in one or more Recipes, but a MashStep only exists as part of a single Mash.
 *           \b BrewNote is owned by its \b Recipe
 *           \b Equipment
 *           \b Fermentable
 *           \b Hop
 *           \b Instruction is owned by its \b Recipe
 *           \b Mash
 *           \b MashStep is owned by its \b Mash
 *           \b Misc
 *           \b Recipe
 *           \b Salt
 *           \b Style
 *           \b Water
 *           \b Yeast
 *
 *        I know \b NamedEntity isn't the snappiest name, but it's the best we've come up with so far.  If you look at
 *        older versions of the code, you'll see that this class has previously been called \b Ingredient and
 *        \b BeerXMLElement.  The current name tries to best reflect what the class represents.  Although some of this
 *        class's subclasses (eg \b Hop, \b Fermentable, \b Yeast) are ingredients in the normal sense of the word,
 *        others (eg \b Instruction, \b Equipment, \b Style, \b Mash) are not really.  Equally, the fact that derived
 *        classes can be instantiated from BeerXML is not their defining characteristic.
 *
 *        NOTE: One of the things that can be confusing about our class and DB structure is that we are often
 *        doubling-up two different concepts: a global "variety" record/object and a recipe-specific "use of"
 *        record/object.  Eg, there might be one global "variety" record/object for Fuggle hops, with information about
 *        origin, average alpha acid etc.  Then, each time this type of hop is used in a recipe, there will be a
 *        related record with information about quantity used, actual alpha acid, etc PLUS a COPY of all the information
 *        in the variety record.  The "use of" and "variety" records are stored in the same DB table and the
 *        relationship between them is tracked via parent_id/child_id - where "variety" is the parent and "use of" is
 *        the child.
 *           This structure exists for historical reasons because the code was originally modelled on the BeerXML data
 *        structure (which doesn't really distinguish between "variety" and "use of") and, in the beginning, did not use
 *        a relational database (operating directly on BeerXML files instead).
 *           If we were starting today from a blank sheet of paper, you might, quite reasonably, argue that we should
 *        have separate DB tables and classes for "variety" and "use of" -- eg HopVariety and HopUse (or HopAddition).
 *        However, given where we actually are at the moment, it would be a very considerable amount of work to get to
 *        such a structure -- and it feels like we have a lot more important issues to which we should devote our
 *        efforts.
 *           Moreover, such a would actually remove some potentially valuable flexibility from the code.  It is open to
 *        debate exactly which fields belong in the "variety" record, which ones belong in the "use of" record, and
 *        which ones should be should be in both, and we might want to leave it open (within reason) for different users
 *        to do different things.  Eg, for hops, BeerJSON requires name and alpha acid in both types of records, allows
 *        (but does not require) producer, product ID, origin, year, form (ie leaf/pellet/etc) and beta acid in either
 *        type, but only allows oil content and inventory information in the "variety" record.  This isn't wrong per se,
 *        but it means that, if you want separate BeerJSON inventory records for Fuggle 2021 harvest and Fuggle 2022
 *        harvest, then you need two separate Fuggle variety records, which might not be what you want.  (This also then
 *        makes you think there should be three types of Hop record, but I'm not going to go there!)
 *           So, for the moment at least, we (mostly) retain the idea that a single class/table for both "variety" and
 *        "use of" objects/records.  You just have to be mindful of this when looking at the code and the DB -- eg
 *        the amount field of a Hop can be either inventory or how much to add to a recipe, depending on whether it's a
 *        "variety" or "use of" record.
 *        .:TODO:. It would be good to make explicit which member variables (and their getters/setters) are valid ONLY
 *        for "use of".
 *
 *        NOTE: Although we can template individual member functions, we cannot make this a template class (eg to use
 *        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern) because the Qt Meta-Object Compiler (moc)
 *        cannot handle templates, and we want to be able to use the Qt Property system as well as signals and slots.
 *
 *        NOTE: Because NamedEntity inherits from QObject, no extra work is required to store pointers to NamedEntity
 *        objects inside QVariant.  We also get to have Qt properties for free.  Because we do not use any state in the
 *        QObject from which we inherit, we can get away with not trying to move/copy such state in our copy
 *        constructor, assignment operator, etc.  This is good because there isn't a handy way to do such moves or
 *        copies.
 *
 *        NOTE: When modifying or extending subclasses of \c NamedEntity, there are mostly plenty of examples to guide
 *        you, but a couple of things are worth knowing in advance:
 *          - Attributes that we want to be able to store, eg in the DB and/or in an XML or JSON file, need to be Qt
 *            properties.  There are then mappings in xml/BeerXml.cpp, json/BeerJson.cpp and
 *            database/ObjectStoreTyped.cpp that determine how these properties are read/written.
 *          - Our data structures have, for obvious reasons, been quite heavily influenced by BeerXML and BeerJSON.  The
 *            latter is a much larger data model than the former, so there are a few minor contortions in the BeerXML
 *            mappings (as you'll see from the comments in xml/BeerXml.cpp).
 *          - Because Qt properties don't really handle Null (or std::optional), there are a few places in the code
 *            where we say "we'll treat this value as null".  Eg, for any int that's a DB key, -1 means it's null.
 *          - Mostly the order of enum values should not matter, eg for serialisation where we generally to convert to
 *            strings.  \b However, the .ui files and the .conf file still contain a lot of instances where the order
 *            and/or the int value of an enum do matter, so it's best to avoid changing this, for now at least.
 *
 * .:TODO:. It would be nice to have a canonical serialisation of enums
