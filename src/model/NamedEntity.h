 * \class NamedEntity
 *
 * \brief The base class for our substantive storable items.  There are really two sorts of storable items: ones that
 *        are freestanding and ones that are owned by other storable items.  Eg, a Hop exists in its own right and may
 *        or may not be used in one or more Recipes, but a MashStep only exists as part of a single Mash.
 *           \b BrewNote is owned by its \b Recipe
 *           \b Equipment
 *           \b Fermentable
 *           \b Hop
 *           \b Instruction is owned by its \b Recipe
 *           \b Mash
 *           \b MashStep is owned by its \b Mash
 *           \b Misc
 *           \b Recipe
 *           \b Salt
 *           \b Style
 *           \b Water
 *           \b Yeast
 *
 * Note that this class has previously been called \b Ingredient and \b BeerXMLElement.  We've changed the name to try
 * to best reflect what the class represents.  Although some of this class's subclasses (eg \b Hop, \b Fermentable,
 * \b Yeast) are ingredients in the normal sense of the word, others (eg \b Instruction, \b Equipment, \b Style,
 * \b Mash) are not really.  Equally, the fact that derived classes can be instantiated from BeerXML is not their
 * defining characteristic.
 *
 * NB: Although we can template individual member functions, we cannot make this a template class (eg to use
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern) because the Qt Meta-Object Compiler (moc) cannot
 * handle templates, and we want to be able to use the Qt Property system as well as signals and slots.
 *
 * NB: Because NamedEntity inherits from QObject, no extra work is required to store pointers to NamedEntity objects
 *     inside QVariant
