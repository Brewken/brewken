/**
 * \brief Small template base class to provide common functionaility for recipe addition classes: \c RecipeAdditionHop,
 *        \c RecipeAdditionFermentable, \c RecipeAdditionMisc, \c RecipeAdditionYeast.
 *
 *        This follows the corresponding BeerJSON \c HopAdditionType, \c FermentableAdditionType, etc types.  (However,
 *        note that we do \b not have a class corresponding with BeerJSON's \c WaterAdditionType as it's simpler just to
 *        include the two component fields directly in \c Recipe.)
 *
 *        As elsewhere we use the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) to allow us to template as much as
 *        possible given the constraints on templating in the Qt meta-object compiler (moc).
 *
 * TBD: Do we still need this class?!?
 *
 * \param Derived = the derived class, eg \c RecipeAdditionHop
 * \param Ingredient = the ingredient class, eg \c Hop
