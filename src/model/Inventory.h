/**
 * \brief Class representing an inventory entry for Hop/Fermentable/Yeast/Misc
 *
 *        Initial version of this class holds rather minimal data, but we envisage expanding it in future
 *
 *        NB: When we add, eg, a Hop to a Recipe, we make a copy for various reasons (including that the amount of Hop
 *            used in the Recipe is stored in the Hop, not the Recipe).  Each such copy _shares_ its Inventory with the
 *            Hop from which it was copied (aka its parent).  Thus all the Hops with the same parent will have the
 *            same Inventory object as that parent (because they are not really different Hops, merely different usages
 *            of that parent hop).
 *
 *            We want each type of inventory to be a different class so that it works with \c ObjectStoreTyped
 *
 *            It would be tempting to make Inventory a templated class (for \c Inventory<Hop>,
 *            \c Inventory<Fermentable>, etc), however we need Inventory to inherit from QObject so we can use Qt
 *            Properties in the \c ObjectStore layer, and this precludes the use of templates.  (The Qt meta-object
 *            compiler, aka moc, does not understand C++ templates.)
 *
 *            Instead we use inheritance to get \c InventoryHop, \c InventoryFermentable, etc, which is a bit more
 *            clunky, but not a lot.  And there are a few tricks in the cpp file that still allow us to do some
 *            templating.
