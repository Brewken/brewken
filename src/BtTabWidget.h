 *
 * \brief To implement drag'n'drop, you need to subclass the dropEvent. I
 * think I need to implement this as a dragMoveEvent, the dragEnterEvent and
 * the dropEvent.
 *
 * Some implementation notes. The acceptMime string is used to determine which
 * kind of drop a given pane will accept. I don't want (for example) the
 * recipe pane accepting ingredient drops. This parameter is actually set
 * as a dynamic property on the UI object.
