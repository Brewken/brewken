    * \param updatee The object we are updating - eg recipe
    * \param doer The method on the updatee to do the addition or removal.
    *             This should return the object that needs to be passed in to the \c undoer method.
    *             For certain classes - eg Fermentable, Hop - adding an object actually adds a new object which is
    *             the "child" of the one passed in.  Thus adding a Fermentable to a recipe returns the new copy
    *             ("child") Fermentable that was created; removing a Fermentable from a recipe returns its original
    *             "parent" Fermentable.
    * \param listToAddOrRemove The list of things we're adding or removing - eg fermentable
    * \param undoer The method on the updatee to undo the addition or removal
    * \param doCallback The method on MainWindow to call after doing/redoing the change - typically to update
    *                   other display elements.  If null, no callback is made.
    * \param undoCallback The method on MainWindow to call after undoing the change - typically to update
    *                     other display elements.  If null, no callback is made.
    * \param description Short text we can show on undo/redo menu to describe this update eg "Change Recipe Style"
    * \param parent This is for grouping updates together.
