/**
 * \brief Functions that manage remembering settings across sessions.
 *        Most of the heavy lifting is done by Qt's QSettings class.  We just add some minor extensions and make the
 *        interface more consistent with QHash, QMap, etc.
 *
 *        Users should bear in mind the following guidelines, based on QSettings documentation:
 *          - Always refer to the same key using the same case. For example, if you refer to a key as "text fonts" in
 *            one place in your code, don't refer to it as "Text Fonts" somewhere else.
 *          - Avoid key names that are identical except for the case. For example, if you have a key called
 *            "MainWindow", don't try to save another key as "mainwindow".
 *          - Do not use slashes or backslashes in section or key names
 *          - Avoid key names that are the same as section names
