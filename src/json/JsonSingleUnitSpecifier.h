/**
 * \brief Defines the expected unit for an JSON value:unit pairs that only ever uses one unit (eg percentages in
 *        BeerJSON).
 *
 *        The advantage of using this struct is that it allows us to assert that the unit we're reading is what we
 *        expected, which should catch programming errors (eg if we try to read a percentage field into a pH attribute).
 *
 * \c expectedUnit tells us what we are expecting the unit to be
 * \c unitField is the key used to pull out the string value representing the units of the measurement, usually "unit" in
 *              BeerJSON
 * \c valueField is the key used to pull out the double value representing the measurement itself
