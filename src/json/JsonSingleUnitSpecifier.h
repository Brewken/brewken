/**
 * \brief Defines the expected unit for an JSON value:unit pairs that only ever uses one unit (eg percentages in
 *        BeerJSON).
 *
 *        We need this when outputting JSON to know how to write the value:unit pair.  But it is also useful when
 *        reading a JSON file, as it allows us to assert that the unit we're reading is what we expected, which should
 *        catch programming errors (eg if we try to read a percentage field into a pH attribute).
 *
 * \c validUnits tells us what the unit is allowed to be.  This is a list because, in some cases, there can be
 *               more than on name for the same unit - eg, in BeerJSON, "1", "unit", "each", "dimensionless" and "pkg"
 *               are all allowed for a quantity without any physical units.
 *
 *               The first item in the list is the one we will always use for generating this type of JSON field.
 *
 * \c unitField is the key used to pull out the string value representing the units of the measurement, usually "unit" in
 *              BeerJSON
 *
 * \c valueField is the key used to pull out the double value representing the measurement itself
