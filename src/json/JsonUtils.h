    *                      useful to have them.  Turning this option on will cause C/C++-style comments in the document

    * \brief Output a \c boost::json::value to a stream as nicely formatted valid JSON.  Essentially adds nice

    *
    *        By default, Boost.JSON outputs JSON that takes minimal space but isn't very readable.  JSON isn't a
    *        complicated standard, so making it readable is a small algorithm.
    *
    * \param stream The stream to output to
    * \param val    The value to serialise
    * \param tabString What indentation to use.  Typically we would pass in two or three spaces ("  " or "   "), but
    *                  should work even for heresies such as "        " and "\t".
    *                  Set to "" to turn off all indentation and line breaks (ie Boost.JSON native serialisation).
    * \param currentIndent Allows the function to call itself recursively, keeping track of the current indent level.
    *                      Normally the initial call should omit this parameter so it defaults to \c nullptr.
