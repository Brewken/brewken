    * \param allowComments Strictly, JSON documents are not allowed to contain comments.  In reality, it is sometimes
    *                      useful to have them.  Turning this option on will cause C/C++-style comments in the document
    *                      being opened to be ignored (rather than generate an error).
    *
    * \throw BtException containing text that can be displayed to the user
