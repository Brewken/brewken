/**
 * \brief \c JsonXPath is, essentially, almost the same as a JSON Pointer (see
 *        https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) with the exception that the leading '/' character is optional.
 *
 *        Essentially, this gives us something very akin to the simpler parts of XML's XPath.  We add a few other bits
 *        (see below) but we do not try to replicate the full XPath functionality -- just the small subset that we need.
 *
 *        We have a couple of motivations for omitting the leading '/' character and one motivation for using a rather
 *        different name (XPath rather than Pointer).
 *
 *        JSON Pointers are defined in terms of a JSON document, but any non-leaf node in a JSON document tree can be
 *        treated as a JSON document (at least for the purposes of navigation) and, eg, Boost.JSON supports using a JSON
 *        Pointer as a relative reference from any node.  So, when we are dealing with relative paths in the document
 *        tree, the leading '/' on a JSON Pointer can sometimes be a bit confusing.
 *
 *        Just as importantly, where a relative JSON Pointer refers to a key directly inside the current object, we'd
 *        like it to have the same syntax as accessing that key directly.  Eg, suppose the node we are looking at in a
 *        JSON document includes the following:
 *           "name": "Super Hops",
 *           "origin": "Planet Krypton",
 *           "alpha_acid": {
 *             "unit": "%",
 *             "value": 4.5
 *           }
 *        We would like to be able to refer to "name", "origin", "alpha_acid", "alpha_acid/unit" and "alpha_acid/value".
 *        We don't want to have to distinguish between "/name" and "name" depending on whether we are accessing that
 *        property via key:value pair or JSON Pointer.  (Of course, we could just put a '/' at the front of everything,
 *        but it seems redundant, especially as, in reality, >90% of the references we make are to direct children of
 *        the current node.
 *
 *        We prefer XPath over Pointer because the former is unambiguous (and has a valid strong analogy with a file
 *        system path).
 *
 *        NOTE: Somewhat after writing this I discovered JSONPath at https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/index.html,
 *              which has a lot richer functionality than JSON Pointers but is only one of many competing proposals for
 *              querying JSON (including the jq tool at https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).  These are interesting (eg
 *              `equipment_items[?(@.form=="Mash Tun")]` gives the element(s) of the equipment_items array that have a
 *              form field equal to "Mash Tun"), but they are not currently supported by Boost.JSON.  So, for now, we
 *              we continue with our wrapper around JSON Pointer.
 *
 *        \b Additions: There are certain places where we need to be able to pick out a named item in an array, eg
 *        because of the way BeerJSON stores equipment.  The XPath format for, eg, accessing the entry in an
 *        "equipment_items" array whose "form" field is "Mash Tun", is `equipment_items[form="Mash Tun"]`.  We implement
 *        this part of XPath too, but in the simplest way possible.
