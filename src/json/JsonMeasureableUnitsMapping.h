/**
 * \brief Maps a set of BeerJSON "measurable units" to our internal data structures (\c Measurement::Unit in particular)
 *
 *        In BeerJSON at least, a lot of values are given as value:unit pairs.  (This contrasts with BeerXML and our
 *        internal storage, where everything is STORED in standard, usually SI, units and conversion to other units is
 *        only done for display and entry.)
 *
 * \c scaleKey is the key used to pull out the string value representing the units of the measurement, usually "unit" in
 *             BeerJSON
 * \c scaleValue is the key used to pull out the double value representing the measurement itself
 * \c scaleToUnits tells us how to map the string unit value to one of our \c Measurement::Unit constants
