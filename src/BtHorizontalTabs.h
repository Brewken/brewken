/**
 * \brief A custom style class for \c QTabBar (eg of a \c QTabWidget with tabs on the left \c QTabBar::RoundedWest) to
 *        rotate the tabs so that their text is horizontal instead of the default vertical.  This looks neater when we
 *        have potentially long tab text on a widget that is not hugely tall.
 *
 *        To use on, say, \c myQTabWidget, a pointer to \c QTabWidget, call
 *        \c myQTabWidget->tabBar()->setStyle(new BtHorizontalTabs);
 *
 *        NOTE: This is a commonly-used approach that works on Windows and Linux, but not entirely on Mac.  It's fine on
 *              Mac for tabs with square icons in, but doesn't work properly for tabs with text. (If you look at the Qt
 *              source code, eg https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tree/src/widgets/widgets/qtabbar.cpp?h=5.15,
 *              you'll see some special handling for Mac OS, so perhaps this is something to do with it.)
 *
 *              If we wanted a more sure-fire way of achieving horizontal text in left-hand tabs, we could, in
 *              principle, create our own classes that inherit from \c QTabWidget and \c QTabBar.  But I fear we'd end
 *              up re-implementing a lot of the inner workings of those classes, which would be rather painful.  For
 *              now, we leave text in its default orientation on Mac.
