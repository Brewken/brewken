 * \class BtLabel
 *
 * \brief Performs the necessary magic to select display units for any label.  Specifically, this allows the user to
 *        right-click on the label for a field and select
 *           (a) which unit system to use for that field (eg US Customary (mass), Imperial (mass) or Metric/SI (mass)
 *               for a weight field)
 *           (b) which units within that system to use for the field (eg kg, g, mg if the user has selected Metric/SI on
 *               a weight field).
 *        Moreover, the settings for each label are remembered (via PersistentSettings) for future times the program is
 *        run.
 *
 *        This has been a rather hidden feature of the program as there were no visual clues that right-clicking on a
 *        field label would bring up a useful menu (and it is not common behaviour in other software).  Where possible,
 *        we have now made it so that
 *          • mouseover on the label underlines the label text (hopefully making the user think of a clickable link),
 *          • where left-clicking would otherwise have no effect, it now has the same effect as right-click.
 *
 *        A \c BtLabel (or subclass thereof) will usually have a corresponding \c BtLineEdit (or subclass thereof).
 *        These two widgets will be Qt buddies, which just means that the \c BtLineEdit accepts the input focus on
 *        behalf of the \c BtLabel when the user types the label's shortcut key combination.
 *
 *        When the \c BtLabel needs to tell the \c BtLineEdit that the \c UnitSystem etc has changed, it sends a
 *        \c changedUnitSystemOrScale signal.   (Previously this signal was called \c labelChanged.)

    *        NB: This is mostly referenced in .ui files, which compile to string-based connection syntax (see
    *        https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/signalsandslots-syntaxes.html for difference from functor-based syntax that we
    *        generally prefer to use in .cpp files).  Note too that, if you are manually editing a .ui file rather than
    *        using Qt Designer, you must NOT put parameter names in the function declarations in the \<signal\> and
    *        \<slot\> tags inside the \<connection\> tag.
    *
    *        The idea is that fields affected by a change in forced system of measurement or scale (including to/from
    *        "default") can take current value, convert it to Metric/SI under the "old" settings, then redisplay it with
    *        whatever the new settings are.  Because the fields don't store the "old" settings, we have to send them.
    *        (They can get the new ones just by calling \c Measurement::getUnitSystemForField() etc.
    *
    *        There will always be an old \c SystemOfMeasurement, even if it's the global default for this field's
    *        \c PhysicalQuantity.  There might not be an old \c RelativeScale though, hence the \c std::optional.
    *
    *          .:TODO:. Fix this comment and/or the code
    *        Note that we are OK to use std::optional here as, per https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/signalsandslots.html, "Signals
    *        and slots can take any number of arguments of any type. They are completely type safe."  HOWEVER, when
    *        referring to the function signature in .ui files, we need to remember to escape '<' to "&lt;" and '>' to
    *        "&gt;" because .ui files are XML.
