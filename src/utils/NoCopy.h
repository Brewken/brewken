/**
 * \brief This is a useful macro to include in header file to prevent a class being copyable.  Instead of writing, eg:
 *
 *           //! No copy constructor, as never want anyone, not even our friends, to make copies of a singleton
 *           ObjectStore(ObjectStore const &) = delete;
 *           //! No assignment operator , as never want anyone, not even our friends, to make copies of a singleton.
 *           ObjectStore & operator=(ObjectStore const &) = delete;
 *           //! No move constructor
 *           ObjectStore(ObjectStore &&) = delete;
 *           //! No move assignment
 *           ObjectStore & operator=(ObjectStore &&) = delete;
 *
 *        we write:
 *
 *           NO_COPY_DECLARATIONS(ObjectStore)
