/**
 * \brief Class for compile-time constant ASCII strings
 *
 *        This is a thin wrapper around char const * const that ensures the right thing happens when you do comparisons
 *        with ==, ie meaning you don't have to remember to use std::strcmp.  This is useful, because comparing two
 *        compile-time constant strings with == often "works" almost all the time (because two identical strings are
 *        just pointers to the same memory location) but not always (because one particular compiler will have done its
 *        optimisation differently and there are actually two different locations in memory holding identical strings).
 *
 *        In a Qt application such as ours, you might thing we could use QString const instead of char const * const.
 *        This has two disadvantages.  Firstly, we sometimes need the constant as a char const * -- eg to pass to Qt
 *        property functions such as QObject::property() and QObject::setProperty().  Although char const * into a
 *        QString is trivial, doing the reverse, ie getting getting char const * out of a QString, is a bit painful
 *        (because QString is inherently UTF-16 so you end up creating implicit or explicit temporaries to hold char *
 *        data etc).
 *
 *        The second disadvantage of QString for string constants is that QString does clever reference counting
 *        internally (see https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/implicit-sharing.html).  In theory this is invisible to users of
 *        QString and never a problem.  In practice, you have to be careful about, say, a struct containing
 *        QString const &, as you can break the reference-counting logic and get a segfault (at least on Clang on Mac OS
 *        with Qt 5.9.5).
