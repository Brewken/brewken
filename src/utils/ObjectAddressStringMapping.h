/**
 * \brief For global const objects, such as \c Unit, \c UnitSystem and so on, this provides a mechanism to map them
 *        to or from a string ID suitable for storing in the DB.  Eg for a recipe addition amount or inventory amount
 *        that can be measured by mass or by volume, we would use a pointer or reference to
 *        \c Measurement::Units::kilograms or \c Measurement::Units::liters in memory, we might store "kilograms" or
 *        "liters" in the database.
 *
 *        Although, in cases where we are using this mapping, there would often be an alternative of "just" storing eg
 *        \c Measurement::PhysicalQuantity, it's better that data in the database be as unambiguous as possible - both
 *        for debugging and for any users who want to look at or use the database data directly.  Thus rather than
 *        "quantity : 3.2 / measure : 'mass'", we prefer "quantity : 3.2 / unit : 'kilograms'".  However, we still stick
 *        to the principle of only storing things in canonical metric values, so the code will assert if it finds an
 *        amount stored in the DB in grams or ounces.
 *
 *        NOTE unlike, eg, \c Measurement::Unit::name, the serialisation strings (a) are not localised and (b) should be
 *        globally unique for the type we are dealing with (hence "liters" and "lintner" rather than "L" and "L").  The
 *        latter constraint means, among other things, that we only need one lookup table for all global Unit objects
 *        (\c Measurement::Units::unitStringMapping) rather than multiple individual ones.
