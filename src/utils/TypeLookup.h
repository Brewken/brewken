/**
 * \brief Together with \c std::is_enum from \c <type_traits>, the \c is_optional and \c is_optional_enum templates
 *        defined here give us a generic way at compile time to determine whether a type T is:
 *           1. an enum
 *           2. an instance of std::optional< U > for some enum U
 *           3. an instance of std::optional< U > for some other type U
 *           4. neither an instance of std::optional nor an enum
 *        The four cases:
 *
 *           --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *           |     T               | std::is_enum<T> | is_optional<T> | is_optional_enum<T> |
 *           --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *           |                     |                 |                |                     |
 *           | an enum             |      true       |     false      |        false        |
 *           |                     |                 |                |                     |
 *           | other non optional  |      false      |     false      |        false        |
 *           |                     |                 |                |                     |
 *           | std::optional enum  |      false      |     true       |        true         |
 *           |                     |                 |                |                     |
 *           | other std::optional |      false      |     true       |        false        |
 *           |                     |                 |                |                     |
 *           --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *        Template metaprogramming is sometimes very useful but can be a bit painful to follow.  What we've done here
 *        (at the simple end of things!) is somewhat inspired by the examples at:
 *        https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/type_traits/doc/html/boost_typetraits/background.html
 *
 *        Normally we shouldn't need to use these templates directly outside of the \c TypeLookup class because the
 *        \c PROPERTY_TYPE_LOOKUP_ENTRY macro below takes care of everything for constructor calls where you would
 *        otherwise need them.

    *             is for internal use only (but nonetheless stored in the DB etc), then this field should be
    *             \c std::nullopt
    *           - Things that we think can be deduced now might not always remain so.  Eg, at a future date, it is at
    *             least conceivable that there might be some new \c NonPhysicalQuantity that we also want to store in a
    *             \c QString

/**

 *        (subclass of) \c NamedEntity ought to know itself whether a field is optional/nullable.  This is enough for
 *        serialisation (where we just need to know eg whether we're reading/writing `double` or
 *        `std::optional<double>`).
 *
 *        In principle we might be able to avoid the need for this class and instead construct a look-up table at run
 *        time by making a bunch of calls to \c qRegisterMetaType(std::optional<T>) during start-up for all types \c T
 *        and storing the resulting IDs in a set or list that we then consult to discover whether a property is
 *        of type \c T or \c std::optional<T>.  But I _think_ the approach here is easier to debug.
