 *        user how many objects (hops, recipes, etc) we (a) skipped over (eg because they were duplicates) and (b)
 *        loaded successfully.  (We don't need to do this for exports as there's no duplicate management to do in that
 *        direction.)
 *
 * Note that we use a QMap and not a QHash here as it's nice to be able to run through the keys in alphabetical
 * order when generating the summary message for the user.  (See eg code in xml/XmlCoding.cpp that does this.)
