/**
 * \brief In our (de)serialisation code (to and from database, BeerXML, BeerJSON), we mostly, but not always, have a
 *        one-to-one relationship between "object in our data model" and "record in the format we are serailising
 *        to/from".  Where such a 1-1 mapping is not possible, we can often bridget the gap with XPaths and XPath-like
 *        identifiers.  Eg, a \c JsonXPath allows a property on a model object to map to a field on a sub-record of
 *        the corresponding BeerJSON record.
 *
 *        This \c PropertyPath class allows us to do the reverse: have a field on a BeerJSON or BeerXML record map to a
 *        property of a "sub-object" of the corresponding model object.
 *
 *        Eg, in a BeerXML RECIPE record, the BOIL_SIZE and BOIL_TIME fields need (now) to map to the \c preBoilSize_l
 *        and \c boilTime_mins properties on the \c Boil object contained/referenced in the \c boil property of a
 *        \c Recipe object.  In an XPath we would express this as \c boil/preBoilSize_l and \c boil/boilTime_mins.
 *        Here, because we use constants for our property names, rather than join, eg, the raw strings "boil" and
 *        "boilTime_mins", we actually want to refer to \c PropertyNames::Recipe::boil and
 *        \c PropertyNames::Boil::boilTime_mins, so it's more natural to do that as:
 *
 *           {PropertyNames::Recipe::boil, PropertyNames::Boil::boilTime_mins}
