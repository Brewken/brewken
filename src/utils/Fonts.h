/**
 * \class Fonts  Holds info about open source fonts that we ship with the application.
 *
 *        This is a bit of a nothing singleton class, but it's a mechanism for having constant values
 *        (\c Fonts::TexGyreSchola_Regular etc) that are initialised after the program starts running.
 *
 *        We we cannot rely on automatic initialisation of the font family name variables, because there isn't an easy
 *        way for the compiler to know that it would need to initialise the Qt resource system before initialising
 *        \c Fonts::TexGyreSchola_Regular etc.
 *
 *        We rely on the constructor being called after \c main is invoked (the first time \c getInstance is called) so
 *        that we can read in the font resources at a time they are definitely available.
 *
 *        It doesn't matter how early in the program execution you call \c Fonts::getInstance because, per
 *        https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/resources.html, "Resources embedded in C++ executable or library code are
 *        automatically registered to the Qt resource system in a constructor of an internal global variable.  Since
 *        the global variables are initialized before main() runs, the resources are available when the program
 *        starts to run."
