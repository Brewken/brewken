    * \enum PhysicalQuantity lists the various types of measurable physical quantity
    *       (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity) for which we need to be able to store values
    *
    *       A particular physical quantity can be measured using one or more units of measurement
    *       (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement) -- see \c Unit -- which in certain contexts we also
    *       call scales of measurement (because otherwise you'd be writing stilted phrases such as "measured in
    *       Celsius units of measurement" instead of the more idiomatic "measured on the Celsius scale").
    *
    *       Certain units of measurement (or scales) are grouped together into systems of measurement
    *       (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_measurement).  A system of measurement will typically cover
    *       various physical quantities and, for each of these, have one or more related units (aka scales) of
    *       measurement.  Where there are several related scales, we will typically implement only a subset of them
    *       that make sense for our application.  We will typically omit very small or very large scales - eg we don't
    *       include the grain or ton scales for weight/mass from the US Customary system of measurement.
    *
    *       Internally, we use a single unit of measurement for each physical quantity that we store any measure of.
    *       (These are usually SI units, where they apply, except that, because we're not in science lab, we store
    *       temperature in Celsius rather than Kelvin and usually refer to "the metric system" rather than "SI" or
    *       "International System of Measurement".)  Thus we always store measurements of volume in liters,
    *       measurements of weight (or, more strictly, mass) in kilograms, and so on.
    *
    *       However, we want users to be able to work with whatever (common) units of measurement are most appropriate
    *       to them.  So, for each physical quantity, we allow the user to choose a system of measurement (where they
    *       exist) or a scale (where no relevant systems of measurement exist) for display and default entry of each
    *       type of physical quantity.
    *
    *       Note that, although a system of measurement may cover several physical quantities (eg volume, mass,
    *       temperature) we allow users to make separate choices for each type of physical quantity, as this reflects
    *       what currently happens in the real world, where there is sometimes, for instance, partial migration from
    *       imperial to metric.
    *
    *       To keep the code simple, we group related scales together into a \c UnitSystem.  Eg, the \c UnitSystem for
    *       metric mass has scales (ie const \c Unit objects) for milligrams, grams and kilograms; the one for US
    *       Customary mass has pounds and ounces.
    *
    *       Thus, each \c Unit belongs to exactly one \c UnitSystem and each \c UnitSystem relates to exactly one
    *       \c Measurement::PhysicalQuantity (which also means, of course, that \c Unit relates to exactly one
    *       \c Measurement::PhysicalQuantity, as you would expect).
    *
    *       Additionally, each \c Unit knows how to convert itself to and from the canonical metric \c Unit that we
    *       use for internal storage of the corresponding physical quantity type.
    *
    *       It can be that \c Measurement::PhysicalQuantity only has one \c UnitSystem (eg, for time, we only want to
    *       measure things in the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) units of seconds/minutes/hours/days/etc; we don't,
    *       for instance, want to support Metric time, Hexadecimal time or the beeps, hectobeeps and decidays of the
    *       Lukashian Calendar).  In this case, we do not offer the user a Hobson's choice of \c UnitSystem, we just
    *       use the sole one available.
    *
    *       It can also be that a \c UnitSystem has only one \c Unit (eg the two ways we support for measuring density
    *       each only have one scale).  In this case, it will feel to the user as though s/he is choosing a scale (aka
    *       \c Unit) directly rather than a \c UnitSystem, but of course the \c UnitSystem is still there and used.
    *
    *       There is, however, one additional complication.  In certain places, we need to allow a quantity to be
    *       measured either by mass or by volume, according to the user's choice.  Eg for \c Misc ingredients, some will
    *       be best measured by weight and some by volume.  So, eg in \c MiscTableModel, we need to offer the options of
    *       "Imperial", "US Customary" and "Metric/SI" for the amount column without predetermining whether these will
    *       be volume or weight because that will depend on a per-row basis.)  This is what motivates us to model
    *       \c SystemOfMeasurement explicitly.
    *
    *       NOTE that there are other things that users can configure that do not belong with this group of classes
    *       because they do not related to physical quantities, eg date & time format and language choice do not fit
    *       well in here -- see \c NonPhysicalQuantity in \headerfile BtFieldType.h

      // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brix and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Other_density_scales).
      // So we could call this RelativeDensity or SugarConcentration or Gravity.  But I think Density is truest to the

      // Per https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/carbonation, "Carbonation is
      // measured as either ‘volumes’ or grams per litre. One volume means 1 L of CO2 in 1 L of drink.  This is
      // equivalent to 1.96 g/L (normally quoted as 2 g/L)."  Thus, although we're using similar units to measures of
      // concentration, the equivalences are different and, in practice, it's easiest to treat them as a completely
      // separate.
      Carbonation,
      // As explained at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration, there are several types of concentration,
      // including "mass concentration", which is expressed as mass-per-volume, and "volume concentration", which is
      // strictly-speaking a dimensionless number (because volume-per-volume cancels out) but is often expressed as
      // parts per million (or similar) or sometimes as a percentage.
      //
      // BeerJSON just bundles mass concentration and volume concentration scales together under "concentration", which
      // is sufficient for its purposes.  However, we don't want to do that, as we'd end up doing some contrived and
      // incorrect conversion between the two -- because there is no generic conversion between milligrams-per-litre and
      // parts-per-xxx.  (Converting mass-per-volume to volume-per-volume (or mass-per-mass) involves temperature and
      // the molar masses of the two substances in question.  Hence why a chemist would use
      // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration instead.
      //
      // (Various converters on the internet will tell you that 1 mg/L is "the same as" 1 ppm, but this is only really
      // true if everything has the density of water.  In fairness to such converters, in practice, in brewing, for
      // small concentrations, it's often not hugely wrong to approximate 1 milligram-per-litre with 1
      // part-per-million.)
