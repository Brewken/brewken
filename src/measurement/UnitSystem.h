    * \class UnitSystem
    *
    * \brief A unit system is a collection of related \c Units for a particular \c PhysicalQuantity.  It is (often) the
    *        subset of a system of measurement that relates to an individual physical quantity.
    *
    *        From Wikipedia: "A system of measurement is a collection of units of measurement and rules relating them to
    *        each other. ... Systems of measurement in use include the International System of Units (SI), the modern
    *        form of the metric system, the British imperial system, and the United States customary system."
    *
    *        We don't use systems of measurement directly for two reasons:
    *         - Some things we need to measure, such as diastatic power, color, or density aren't covered by some or all
    *           of the common systems of measurement
    *         - Users want to be able to mix-and-match (eg using US customary for volume but metric for temperature)
    *
    *        For each physical quantity (mass, volume, temperature) where we support more than one way of measuring it,
    *        we allow the user to choose a \c UnitSystem that corresponds to (and is named after) the system of
    *        measurement or scale they want to see things displayed in.  This will also determine the units we will
    *        assume for user input if none are specified.  (Thus if the user has chosen to show temperatures in
    *        Fahrenheit then we assume any temperature they input is in Fahrenheit unless they specify that it's in
    *        Celsius.)
    *
    *        Internally we store things in metric (usually, but not always, SI) units, and do the appropriate
    *        conversions for input/display on other scales.  Conversion is handled by \c Unit objects.
    *
    *        See also \c Measurement.

      /**
       * \enum RelativeScale
       *
       * \brief For some types of quantity, a given system of measurement will have multiple units, so we need to be
       *        able to order these units by relative size, eg, for fluid volume:
       *           fluid teaspoon < tablespoon < cup < pint < quart < gallon   (in both Imperial and US Customary systems)
       *           milliliters < liters                                        (in Metric/SI system)
       *        We only worry about units we actually use/permit, thus we don't, for example, care about where minims,
       *        fluid drams, gills etc fit in on the imperial / US customary volume scales, as we don't support them.
       *
       *        NOTE: The names of these enums don't have any significance beyond a relative ordering.  We usually start
       *              with \c ExtraSmall and then use as many of the subsequent entries as necessary.
       *
       *        TODO: I feel this could be replaced with a \c uint8_t that holds the ordering in the \c UnitSystem
       *              constructor.  Then we wouldn't need the pointless names like "ExtraSmall" and "Huge".
