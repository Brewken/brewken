      // is equal to one millipascal-second (mPa·s).

      // centipoise as viscosity measurement in the brewing industry.

      // calories instead of joules was used in chemistry, nutrition and, it seems, brewing.  There are two types of
      // calorie:
      //   - the "small calorie" (or "gram-calorie", "cal") = 4.184 J
      //   - The "grand calorie" (aka "kilocalorie", "kcal" or "Cal") = 1000 small calories = 4184 J
      //
      // However, the specific heat measurement using "cal" is the same as that for "Cal":
      //   1 cal / (°C × g) = 1 Cal / (°C × kg) = 4184 J / (°K × kg) = the specific heat capacity of liquid water
      //
      // So, we only implement "calories per degree Celsius per gram" as it's identical to "kilocalories per degree
      // Celsius per kilogram".
      //
      // NOTE: This is one instance where our "canonical" unit is NOT the metric one.  Historically, the code has always
      //       used "calories per Celsius per gram" rather than "joules per Celsius per kilogram", including for storing
      //       amounts in the DB.   Also the "calories" version is what is used by BeerJSON and BeerXML.
