      // Per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity#Measurement, the SI unit of dynamic viscosity is the newton-second
      // per square meter (N·s/m²), which is (by definition) equivalent to a pascal-second (Pa·s).
      //
      // An alternate metric unit is the poise (P), which is defined as:
      //   1 P = 0.1 m⁻¹·kg·s⁻¹ = 1 cm⁻¹·g ·s⁻¹
      //
      // So 1P = 0.1 Pa·s.
      //
      // In a number of applications, including brewing, it's more common to use centipoise (cP), where 1 cP = 0.01 P,
      // or millipascal-second (mPa·s), where 1 mPa·s = 0.001 Pa·s.  (Thus 1 cP = 1 mPa·s.)   This is because
      // because the viscosity of water at 20 °C is about 1 cP = 1 mPa·s.
      //
      // We always try to use metric units as our "canonical" ones.  We often prefer SI units, but not at the expense of
      // a more commonly-used metric alternative (eg we prefer Celsius over Kelvin).  For viscosity, we use centipoise
      // as canonical because (a) AFAICT it's slightly more commonly used in brewing and (b) it's shorter.
      //
      // See eg https://www.brewingwithbriess.com/blog/understanding-a-malt-analysis/ and
      // https://www.morebeer.com/articles/Understanding_Malt_Analysis_Sheets for reference to common use of
      // centipoise as viscosity measurement in the brewing industry.
      //
      // (US Customary and Imperial offer us pound-seconds per square foot (lb·s/ft2), but thankfully this does not seem
      // to be much used in brewing, so we do not implement it.)
      extern Unit const centipoise;
      extern Unit const millipascalSecond;
      // == Specific Heat Capacity ==
      // Per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_heat_capacity SI units are "joules per kelvin per kilogram" (which
      // is the same as "joules per degree Celsius per kilogram").  However, historically a measurement involving
      // calories instead of joules was used in chemistry, nutrition and, it seems, brewing.  There are two types of
      // calorie:
      //   - the "small calorie" (or "gram-calorie", "cal") = 4.184 J
      //   - The "grand calorie" (aka "kilocalorie", "kcal" or "Cal") = 1000 small calories = 4184 J
      //
      // However, the specific heat measurement using "cal" is the same as that for "Cal":
      //   1 cal / (°C × g) = 1 Cal / (°C × kg) = 4184 J / (°K × kg) = the specific heat capacity of liquid water
      //
      // So, we only implement "calories per degree Celsius per gram" as it's identical to "kilocalories per degree
      // Celsius per kilogram".
      //
      // NOTE: This is one instance where our "canonical" unit is NOT the metric one.  Historically, the code has always
      //       used "calories per Celsius per gram" rather than "joules per Celsius per kilogram", including for storing
      //       amounts in the DB.   Also the "calories" version is what is used by BeerXML.
      //
      // BeerJSON also offers us BTU / (lb × °F).  Note however, that, because a British Thermal Unit (BTU) is defined
      // as "the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit", we
      // have 1 BTU/lb·F = 1 c/g·C.
      //
      // NOTE that you often see a couple of other terms used in brewing-related circles:
      //
      //   - "Heat Capacity" (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity) is different from Specific Heat Capacity.
      //     For a given object (eg a brewing vessel), its Heat Capacity is obtained by multiplying its Mass by its
      //     Specific Heat Capacity.
      //
      //   - "Specific Heat" is just an abbreviation for "Specific Heat Capacity".  We use it for variable names etc in
      //     the interests of brevity, but we try always to use full "Specific Heat Capacity" for display strings to
      //     avoid any ambiguity or confusion.
