       * Despite the fact that the metric system offers many benefits over its imperial predecessors, it's not quite as
       * simple as one might imagine.  In short, there have been multiple metric systems (eg see
       * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system#Common_metric_systems).  The "International System of Units (SI)"
       * is the official one adopted by all countries except Myanmar, Liberia, and the United States.  But it is not
       * always convenient or practical for brewers to use strict SI units -- eg it's far more likely you want to
       * measure wort temperature in Celsius than in Kelvin.
       *
       * So, \c Measurement::SystemOfMeasurement::Metric is probably best thought of as "metric for brewers".
       * Differences from SI include:
       *
       *    - We use Celsius for temperature rather than Kelvin
       *    - We include a volume scale (liters) which, strictly-speaking, SI does not (because you'd use cubic metres)
       *    - We use centipoise for viscosity rather than newton-seconds per square meter
       *      (Poise/centipoise comes from the "Centimetre–gram–second (CGS)" metric system, whose other units have
       *      largely fallen out of use --
       *      see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre%E2%80%93gram%E2%80%93second_system_of_units.)

       * why do not use a metric system of time.)

       * choice about.
