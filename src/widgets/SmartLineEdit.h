 * \class SmartLineEdit
 *
 * \brief Extends QLineEdit to handle unit transformations and formatting
 *
 *        A \c SmartLineEdit widget will usually have a corresponding \c SmartLabel. See comment in
 *        \c widgets/SmartLabel.h for more details on the relationship between the two classes.
 *
 *        Typically, each \c SmartLineEdit and \c SmartLabel instance are declared in a dialog's Qt Designer UI File
 *        (\c ui/hopEditor.ui).  After it is constructed, the needs to be configured via \c SmartLineEdit::configure.
 *
 *        This two-step set-up is needed because AFAIK there is no way to pass constructor parameters to an object in a
 *        .ui file.  (If you want to do that, the advice seems to be to build the layout manually in C++ code.)
 *
 *        Similarly, we might think to template \c SmartLineEdit, but the Qt Meta-Object Compiler (moc) doesn't
 *        understand C++ templates.  This means we can't template classes that need to use the \c Q_OBJECT macro
 *        (required for classes that declare their own signals and slots or that use other services provided by Qt's
 *        meta-object system).
 *
 *        Previously we had a class called \c BtLineEdit (on which this class is based) and used mostly trivial
 *        subclassing to determine the class behaviour.  This was a sort of trick to pass in a constructor parameter.
 *        Classes \c BtStringEdit, \c BtPercentageEdit, would all inherit from \c BtLnneEdit and all do no more than
 *        pass different parameters to the \c BtLineEdit constructor.  This sort of worked when we had relatively few
 *        \c Measurement::UnitSystem classes but was starting to get unwieldy when those were expanded in anticipation
 *        of lots of new field types for BeerJSON.  Also, it had the disadvantage that you had to think about field
 *        types when editing the .ui file rather than being able to leave such details to the corresponding .cpp file.
