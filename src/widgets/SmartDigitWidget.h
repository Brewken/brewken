 * \class SmartDigitWidget
 *
 * \brief Widget that displays colored numbers, depending on if the number is ok, high, or low.  Currently only used in
 *        waterDialog.ui (ie Water Chemistry Dialog).
 *
 * \todo Make this thing directly accept signals from the model items it is supposed to watch.
 *
 *        NB: Per https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/moc.html#multiple-inheritance-requires-qobject-to-be-first, "If you are using
 *        multiple inheritance, moc [Qt's Meta-Object Compiler] assumes that the first inherited class is a subclass of
 *        QObject. Also, be sure that only the first inherited class is a QObject."  In particular, this means we must
 *        put Q_PROPERTY declarations for SmartField attributes here rather than in SmartField itself.
