   // Note that ideally we would specify spacing etc here in points rather than pixels to be independent of display
   // resolution.  HOWEVER, per https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-reference.html#length, Qt only supports points for
   // font sizes and other lengths must be in px (pixels), em (width of 'M' in current font) or ex (height of 'x' in
   // current font).
   //
   // Ideally we would automatically keep the colors here in sync with those in InfoButton, but currently waiting for
   // the Qt API to settle down in this area so we can specify colors in the same way in both places.  (Setting a QColor
   // object using color codes in "#RRGGBB" format is achieved by calling QColor::setNamedColor post-construction until
   // Qt 6.6 when you are supposed to switch to using the QColor::fromString factory function.)

   // You might think that, at this point, we ought to be able to discover the parent dialog (eg EquipmentEditor) from
   // which we are being created -- eg by following a chain of QWidget * parent pointers and calling the
   // QWidget::parentWidget() member function on each one, or simply by invoking the QWidget::window() member function.
   // However, this is unlikely to work in practice.  The code generated from the .ui file does not always set the
   // parent parameter when it constructs a widget.  Eg, in the code generated for equipmentEditor.ui, we might see
   // something along the following lines:
   //
   //    tabWidget_editor = new QTabWidget(equipmentEditor);
   //    ...
   //    tab_general = new QWidget();
   //    ...
   //    infoButton_name = new InfoButton(tab_general);
   //    ...
   //    infoText_name = new InfoText(tab_general);
   //    ...
   //    tabWidget_editor->addTab(tab_general, QString());
   //    ...
   //
   // This means that, in the InfoText and InfoButton constructors, we can only get our direct parent, but cannot access
   // the "ultimate" parent (EquipmentEditor, which inherits from Ui_equipmentEditor).
   //
   // So, my original plan to subclass QDialog and add a signal that EquipmentEditor etc could send after executing
   // setupUi didn't fly.  Fortunately, the alternative of piggy-backing on setText seems to work just fine.
