/**
 * \class InfoText
 *
 * \brief Partner class to \c InfoButton.  This holds the informational text that is shown when the corresponding
 *        \c InfoButton is clicked.  You can add \c InfoButton / \c InfoText pairs in a .ui file without needing any
 *        additional C++ code, provided you set the \c buddy property of the \c InfoText to point to the \c InfoButton,
 *        per the example below.  (An \c InfoButton without a corresponding \c InfoText will be displayed greyed-out.)
 *
 *        Specifically, the .ui file should contain something along the following lines:
 *
 *           <widget class="InfoButton" name="infoButton_foobar"></widget>
 *           ...
 *           <widget class="InfoText" name="infoText_foobar">
 *            <property name="buddy"><cstring>infoButton_foobar</cstring></property>
 *            <property name="text"><string>The info text we want to display...</string></property>
 *           </widget>
 *
 *        No additional code is required in our .cpp or .h files.
 *
 *        This is only possible because \c InfoText inherits from \c QLabel.  The "magic" that makes buddies work is not
 *        a generic Qt feature.  It is hard-coded in the MOC for \c QLabel and we can only use it by deriving from
 *        \c QLabel.  (If you try to code your own equivalent of the buddy property you'll founder on the rocks of the
 *        parameter being passed in as a string instead of magically converted to the address of a QWidget by the MOC.)
 *
 *        This is also why we cannot put the buddy property on the \c InfoButton -- because that does not inherit from
 *        \c QLabel.

   /**
    * \brief We override \c QLabel::setText because we know this will get called \b after all the other widgets in our

    *        \c QLabel::setBuddy member function will have been called.  Since, as noted above, we cannot override that
    *        buddy-setting function (as it would break the magic that allows it to be correctly called from code
    *        generated from the .ui file), we need to jump in at this point instead.
    *
    *        How do we know that \c setText will always be called after \c setBuddy?  It is because the former is called
    *        in \c retranslateUi, which is called at the end of \c setupUi (in which all the objects specified in the
    *        .ui file are created and \c setBuddy is called).  Things have to be done this way round because you need to
    *        be able to call \c retranslateUi directly later on in the program, whereas the rest of the \c setupUi
    *        functionality can only be done once when the parent widget (eg \c EquipmentEditor) is constructed.
