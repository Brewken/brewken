/**
 * \class SmartField
 *
 * \brief Abstract base class that handles all the unit transformation and related logic for displaying a field.  Eg, if
 *        a field holds a volume amount then we need to be able to handle metric / US customary / Imperial systems of
 *        measurement and to deal with different scales (eg milliliters, liters, etc).  Can also deal with a
 *        \c NonPhysicalQuantity, including making sure that we add a '%' to \c NonPhysicalQuantity::Percentage.
 *
 *        The reason we need this base class, is there are two unrelated classes that need to be able to display amounts
 *        & units etc: \c SmartField, which allows amounts to be entered and edited, and \c SmartDigitWidget, which
 *        shows non-editable amounts (typically resulting from a calculation on other fields).
 *
 *                                                   QWidget
 *                                                  /       \
 *                                               ...        QLineEdit
 *                                               /                   \
 *                                              /       SmartField    \
 *                                        QLabel        /        \     \
 *                                       /       \     /          \     \
 *                             SmartLabel      SmartDigitWidget    SmartField
 *
 *        A number of helper functions exist in the \c SmartAmounts namespace.
 *
 *        Note that although \c SmartLabel and \c SmartDigitWidget both inherit from \c QLabel, they serve different
 *        purposes.  \c SmartLabel tells you what a field is, eg "Target Boil Size" and, where appropriate, allows you
 *        to select the \c SystemOfMeasurement and/or \c RelativeScale for the field.  A \c SmartDigitWidget on the
 *        other hand shows the value of a field, eg the total amount of NaCl in a water profile.
 *
 *        A \c SmartLabel and a \c SmartField typically work in conjunction with each other, but there are a number of
 *        edge cases.  See comment in \c widgets/SmartLabel.h for more details.
 *
 *        .:TBD:. There is still a certain amount of code duplication between \c SmartLabel and \c SmartField, which it
 *        would be nice to eliminate somehow.

   /**
    * \brief This needs to be called before the object is used, typically in constructor of whatever editor is using the
    *        widget.  As well as passing in a bunch of info that cannot easily be given to the constructor (per comment
    *        above), it also ensures, if necessary, that the \c changedSystemOfMeasurementOrScale signal from the
    *        \c SmartLabel buddy is connected to the \c lineChanged slot of this \c SmartField.
    *
    *        Note, in reality, you actually use the \c SMART_FIELD_INIT macro (see \c widgets/SmartAmounts.h).
    *
    * \param editorName Name of the owning editor (eg "FermentableEditor").  Together with \c fieldName, should
    *                   uniquely identify this field.
    *
    * \param fieldName Name of the member variable of this field in its owning editor (eg "field_color").
    *                     Together with \c editorName, should uniquely identify this field.
    *
    * \param fieldlFqName This should uniquely identify this field in the application.  (Usually, it's a combination
    *                        of the owning widget and the member variable, eg "FermentableEditor->field_color".)
    *                        This is mainly used for logging, where it helps a lot with debugging.  (We have hundreds of
    *                        instances of this object and if we detect that one of them is misconfigured, it's very
    *                        useful to be able to log which one!)
    *                           We \b could construct this at run-time from \c editorName and \c fieldName, but,
    *                        since we're being invoked via a macro (\c SMART_FIELD_INIT etc), we might as well have the
    *                        compiler/preprocessor do the necessary concatenation at compile-time and hand the results
    *                        in via this parameter.
    *
    * \param typeInfo Tells us what data type we use to store the contents of the field (when converted to canonical
    *                 units if it is a \c PhysicalQuantity) and, whether this is an optional field (in which case we
    *                 need to handle blank / empty string as a valid value).
    *
    * \param buddyLabel Usually needs to be \c QLabel if \c fieldType is a \c NonPhysicalQuantity and \c SmartLabel if
    *                   it is not.  However, a \c PhysicalQuantity (or \c Mixed2PhysicalQuantities) field can have a
    *                   \c QLabel (rather than a \c SmartLabel) where the user does \b not have a choice about units or
    *                   scales (even though they otherwise would for this sort of \c PhysicalQuantity).  This is
    *                   typically used on conversion dialogs, eg \c RefractoDialog, where we are asking the user to give
    *                   us inputs in specific units in order to convert them to other units measuring the same physical
    *                   quantity.
    *
    * \param precision For a decimal field, this determines the number of decimal places to show.  If not specified, we
    *                  show 3 decimal places.  TBD: IDK if one day we might need to be more sophisticated about this, ie
    *                  with number of decimal places dependent on the units that the user has chosen, but for now we
    *                  assume it's the same for everything, but allow modification via \c setPrecision.
    *
    * \param maximalDisplayString Used for determining the width of the widget (because a fixed pixel width isn't great
    *                             in a world where there are varying display DPIs).
