    *
    *         Note the following from https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsqldatabase.html#database:
    *            "An instance of QSqlDatabase represents [a] connection ... to the database. ... It is highly
    *            recommended that you do not keep a copy of [a] QSqlDatabase [object] around as a member of a class,
    *            as this will prevent the instance from being correctly cleaned up on shutdown."
    *
    *         Moreover, there can be multiple instances of a QSqlDatabase object for a single connection.  (Copying
    *         the object does not create a new connection, it just creates a new object that references the same
    *         underlying connection.)
    *
    *         Per https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsqldatabase.html#removeDatabase, ALL QSqlDatabase objects (and QSqlQuery
    *         objects) for a given database connection MUST be destroyed BEFORE the underlying database connection is
    *         removed from Qt's list of database connections (via QSqlDatabase::removeDatabase() static function),
    *         otherwise errors of the form "QSqlDatabasePrivate::removeDatabase: connection ... is still in use, all
    *         queries will cease to work" will be logged followed by messy raw data dumps (ie where binary data is
    *         written to the logs without interpretation).
    *
    *         Thus, all this function does really is (a) generate a thread-specific name for this thread's connection,
    *         (b) have create and register a new connection for this thread if none exists, (c) return a new stack-
    *         allocated QSqlDatabase object for this thread's DB connection.
    *
    *         Callers should not copy the returned QSqlDatabase object nor retain it for longer than is necessary.
    *
    * \return A stack-allocated \c QSqlDatabase object through which this thread's database connection can be accessed.
