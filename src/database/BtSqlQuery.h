/**
 * \class BtSqlQuery is an extension of \c QSqlQuery with more helpful behaviour around prepared statements
 *
 *        It's not clear from the Qt documentation, but it turns out that, if you call QSqlQuery::prepare() on a SQL
 *        statement that doesn't have any placeholders for binding values, then you get  a syntax error when you're
 *        using PostgreSQL; you have to call exec() directly on the SQL.
 *
 *        At one level, this is "correct" because a query without bind value placeholders is not a prepared statement
 *        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement) and so doesn't need preparing.  (Qt is just reporting the
 *        error it gets back from PostgreSQL when it asks it to prepare the statement.)
 *
 *        On the other hand, it's annoying because we have to have tedious special-case handling in code that is not
 *        using local hard-coded SQL.
 *
 *        Since, per discussion in https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-48471, QSqlQuery is unlikely to be fixed or
 *        enhanced to deal with this, we create our own wrapper class that does the right thing.
 *
 *        USAGE:
 *           - Create a BtSqlQuery object
 *           - Call its \c prepare() member function to tell it what SQL you want to execute (regardless of whether it
 *             has bind parameters)
 *           - Call \c bindValue() as necessary for any bind parameters
 *           - Call \c exec() to execute
 *
 *        Note that a syntax error in a prepared statement will not get reported until the first call to \c bindValue()
 *        (and will be reported via logging + run-time exception rather than return value), but otherwise behaviour
 *        should be similar to the way you would want \c QSqlQuery to work.
