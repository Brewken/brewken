/**
 * \brief Base class for storing objects (of a given class) in (a) the database and (b) a local in-memory cache.
 *
 *        This class does all the generic work and, by virtue of being a non-template class, can have most of its
 *        implementation private.  The template class \c DbNamedEntityRecords then does the class-specific work (eg
 *        call constructor for the right type of object) and provides a class- specific interface (so that callers
 *        don't have to downcast return values etc).
 *
 *        Inheritance from QObject is to allow this class to send signals

    *            void newBrewNoteSignal(BrewNote*);
    *            void newEquipmentSignal(Equipment*);
    *            void newFermentableSignal(Fermentable*);
    *            void newHopSignal(Hop*);
    *            void newMashSignal(Mash*);

    *            void newMiscSignal(Misc*);

    *            void newWaterSignal(Water*);
    *            void newYeastSignal(Yeast*);
    *
    *        Note that Qt Signals and Slots can't be in templated classes because part of the code to implement them is
    *        generated by the Meta-Object Compiler (MOC), which runs before main compilation, and therefore before
    *        template instantiation.  Also, when calling QObject::connect() to connect a signal to a slot, you need the
    *        \b object that emits the signal (not the class).
    *
    *        So, we emit the signal here in the virtual base class, and it will be received in slot(s) that have
    *        connected to the relevant singleton instance of the subclass.  (Eg, if you connect a slot to
    *        \c DbNamedEntityRecords<Water>::getInstance() then its going to receive a signal whenever a new Water
    *        object is inserted in the database.
    *
    * \param id The primary key of the newly inserted object.  (For the moment we assume all primary keys are integers.
    *           If we want to extend this in future then we'd change this param to a QVariant.)

    *        NB: This is not virtual because we want subclasses to be able to have a different return type.  (We don't
    *            need virtual here anyway as external callers will not be upcasting subclasses of DbRecords, and even,
