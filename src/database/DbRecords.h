/**
 * \brief Base class for storing objects (of a given class) in (a) the database and (b) a local in-memory cache.
 *
 *        This class does all the generic work and, by virtue of being a non-template class, can have most of its
 *        implementation private.  The template class \c DbNamedEntityRecords then does the class-specific work (eg
 *        call constructor for the right type of object) and provides a class- specific interface (so that callers
 *        don't have to downcast return values etc).
 *
 *        Inheritance from QObject is to allow this class to send signals (and therefore that inheritance needs to be
 *        public).
 *
 * .:TBD:.  Should we rename this to ObjectStoreBase and DbNamedEntityRecords to ObjectStore?  Then could have assistance functions in ObjectStoreWrapper namespace

    * \brief Cross-references to other objects that are stored in a junction table.  (See
    *        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_entity)  Eg, for a Recipe, there are several junction tables
    *        (fermentable_in_recipe, hop_in_recipe, etc) to store info where potentially many other objects
    *        (Fermentable, Hop, etc) are associated with a single recipe.
    *
    *        NB: What we are storing here is the junction table from the point of view of one class.  Eg
    *        fermentable_in_recipe could be seen from the point of view of the Recipe or of the Fermentable.  In this
    *        particular example, it will be configured from the point of view of the Recipe because the Recipe class
    *        knows about which Hops it uses (but the Hop class does not know about which Recipes it is used in).
    *
    *        We assume that each junction table contains only two columns of interest to us, both of which are foreign
    *        keys to other objects, and both of which are integers.  When passing the results to-and-from the object
    *        itself, we'll normally pass a list of integers.  However, if \c assumeMaxOneEntry is set to \c true, then
    *        we'll pull at most one matching row and pass an integer (wrapped in QVariant and thus 0 if no row
    *        returned).
    *
    *        .:TBD:. For reasons that are not entirely clear, the parent-child relationship between various objects is
    *        also stored in junction tables.  Although we could change this, it's more likely we will just drop the
    *        parent-child stuff.

    *        template instantiation.
    *
    *        Also, NB that when calling QObject::connect() to connect a signal to a slot, you need the \b object that
    *        emits the signal (not the class).
    *
    *        So, we emit the signal here in the virtual base class, and it will be received in slot(s) that have
    *        connected to the relevant singleton instance of the subclass.  Eg, if you connect a slot to

    *        object is inserted in the database.

    *        send shared_ptr<QObject> (or even Object *) but then recipients are going to have to downcast it, which
    *        seems a bit clunky.  So, we send the ID of the object, which the recipient can either easily check against
    *        the ID of anything they are holding or use to request an instance of the object.
    *
    * \param id The primary key of the newly inserted object.  (For the moment we assume all primary keys are integers.
