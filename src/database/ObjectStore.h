 * \brief Base class for storing objects (of a given class) in (a) the database and (b) a local in-memory cache.
 *
 *        This class does all the generic work and, by virtue of being a non-template class, can have most of its
 *        implementation private.  The template class \c ObjectStoreTyped then does the class-specific work (eg
 *        call constructor for the right type of object) and provides a class- specific interface (so that callers
 *        don't have to downcast return values etc).
 *
 *        A further namespace \c ObjectStoreWrapper slightly simplifies the syntax of calls into \c ObjectStoreTyped
 *        member functions.
 *
 *        Note that we do not try to implement every single feature of SQL.  This is not a generic object-to-relational
 *        mapper.  It's just as much as we need.
 *
 *        Inheritance from QObject is to allow this class to send signals (and therefore that inheritance needs to be
 *        public).

    * \brief Cross-references to other objects that are stored in a junction table.  (See
    *        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_entity)  Eg, for a Recipe, there are several junction tables
    *        (fermentable_in_recipe, hop_in_recipe, etc) to store info where potentially many other objects
    *        (Fermentable, Hop, etc) are associated with a single recipe.
    *
    *        We could store junction table information in quite a concise structure, but we prefer to extend the same
    *        structure used for primary tables.  This is more consistent, and simplifies some of the code, at the
    *        expense of a little more boilerplate text in the JUNCTION_TABLE definitions in ObjectStoreTyped.cpp.
    *
    *        NB: What we are storing here is the junction table from the point of view of one class.  Eg
    *        fermentable_in_recipe could be seen from the point of view of the Recipe or of the Fermentable.  In this
    *        particular example, it will be configured from the point of view of the Recipe because the Recipe class
    *        knows about which Hops it uses (but the Hop class does not know about which Recipes it is used in).
    *
    *        .:TBD:. For reasons that are not entirely clear, the parent-child relationship between various objects is
    *        also stored in junction tables.  Although we could change this, it's more likely in the long run that we
    *        change how the parent-child stuff works as it currently involves lots of duplicated data.
    *
    * \param tableName
    * \param tableFields  • First entry is the primary key of this table, which we don't explicitly use (other
    *                               than for table creation) and therefore has no property name.
    *                             • Second entry is the foreign key to primary table of this store.  Its property name
    *                               should be the same as that of the primary key of this store's primary table.  Its
    *                               \c foreignKeyTo (which we use only for table creation) should point to the
    *                               \c TableDefinition for this store.
    *                             • Third entry is a field to be stored in the objects managed by this store against
    *                               the property name specified.  If this is a true junction table then its
    *                               \c foreignKeyTo will show what table it is a foreign key to -- information that we
    *                               use only for table creation
    *                             • Fourth entry is optional.  If present, it is used for ordering.  We assume the
    *                               actual values do not matter, just the ordering they imply, so it has no property
    *                               name.
    * \param assumedNumEntries  When passing data between the table and the object, we'll normally pass a list of
    *                           values (typically integers).  However, if \c assumedNumEntries is set to
    *                           \c MAX_ONE_ENTRY, then we'll pull at most one matching row and pass an integer (wrapped
