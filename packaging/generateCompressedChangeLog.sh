# set:
#    CONFIG_APPLICATION_NAME_LC     - Same as projectName in meson.build
#    CONFIG_CHANGE_LOG_UNCOMPRESSED - Input file - same as filesToInstall_changeLogUncompressed in meson.build
#    CONFIG_CHANGE_LOG_COMPRESSED   - Output file
#    CONFIG_PACKAGE_MAINTAINER      - Name and email of a project maintainer conforming to
#                                     https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-binary.html#s-maintainer

# We assume that none of these variables contains single or double quotes (so we can save ourselves having to escape
# the values when we use them below).
#
# First thing we do is check that all these variables are set to something.

# The rest of this script creates a compressed changelog in a Debian-friendly format
#
# Our change log (CHANGES.markdown) uses markdown format, with the following raw structure:
#    ## v1.2.3
#
#    Optional one-line description of the release.
#
#    ### New Features
#
#    * Blah blah blah
#    * etc
#
#    ### Bug Fixes
#
#    * Blah blah blah
#    * etc
#
#    ### Incompatibilities
#
#    None
#
#    ### Release Timestamp
#    Sun, 06 Feb 2022 12:02:58 +0100
#
# However, per https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html#debian-changelog-debian-changelog, Debian change
# logs need to be in the following format:
#    package (version) distribution(s); urgency=urgency
#      [optional blank line(s), stripped]
#      * change details
#      more change details
#      [blank line(s), included in output of dpkg-parsechangelog]
#      * even more change details
#      [optional blank line(s), stripped]
#     -- maintainer name <email address>[two spaces]  date
#
# We are being a bit fast-and-loose in hard-coding the same maintainer name for each release, but I don't thing it's a
# huge issue.
#
# Note that, to keep us on our toes, Debian change log lines are not supposed to be more than 80 characters long.  This
# is non-trivial, but the ghastly bit of awk below gets us most of the way there.
