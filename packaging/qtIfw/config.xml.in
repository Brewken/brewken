   See comments in meson.build for how this file gets processed into mbuild/config.xml and then copied to a subdirectory

   Note that both Qt Install Framework and Meson use the same format for variable substitutions (and Meson won't
   understand comments in this file), so we need to escape @ symbols when they are for Qt ones.

   Once processed and copied this becomes the installer configuration file (see
   https://doc.qt.io/qtinstallerframework/ifw-globalconfig.html)
