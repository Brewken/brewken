# Brewken Changelog

This change log is for high-level user-visible changes to Brewken, intended for consumption by the typical end-user.
Note however that we also process it into a Debian-compliant text change log, so we need to keep the format consistent.
In particular, the Release Timestamp section is needed as part of this (and you need to be meticulous about the date
format therein).
