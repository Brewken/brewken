# Brewken
(https://github.com/Brewken/brewken)

Open source brewing software by and for microbrewers.

He, my name's Matt, and I run a small microbrewery in south-west France.  Although there are existing pieces of software aimed at homebrewers to do recipe design etc, there are extra things to worry about as a microbrewer.  Eg, since you're liable for duty on the beer you produce, you have to keep track more precisely of exactly what you brewed and what happened to it which, for me, includes calculating the volume of beer that left the fermentor by weighing kegs (empty then full) and dividing the weight by the specific gravity.  I started out using various spreadsheets, notebooks and documents to track this, but soon realised it would be much better to have a single integrated piece of software.

Specifically, the aim is to provide:
 - recipe design and scaling
 - inventory management (including cost tracking)
 - brew log
 - batch management
 - sales ledger and duty calculation

Brewken is still at a very early stage of development.  It includes code from Brewtarget.
