        # Usually "ubuntu-latest" is the most recent LTS version of Ubuntu, but there can be a bit of lag between a new
        # LTS release and the update of ubuntu-latest (eg in October 2022, it was still Ubuntu 20.04 rather than 22.04.
        # So we explicitly specify here which versions we want to build on.
        #
        # Note that ubuntu-18.04 is deprecated and we need to remove it by April 2023

      # See https://github.com/Brewken/brewken/wiki/Development:-Getting-Started for more on what is needed to build
      # the software.  It seems we can assume the following packages are already installed:
      #    cmake
      #    git
      #    debhelper
      #    rpm
      #
      # Some of the things below could be installed via actions (actions/setup-python@v4, jurplel/install-qt-action@v3)
      # but there's an advantage, where we can, in doing the exact same steps that give as instructions to developers to
      # set up their build environment.
