      # Install MSYS2, then Python, then Pip
      #
      # We need Python 3.10 or later to run the bt script
      #
      # I tried using the separate actions/setup-python@v4 action, but it doesn't seem to result in the Python
      # executable being visible in the MSYS2 environment.  So, instead, we install from inside MSYS2.  (According to
      # https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-python, this is Python 3.10.9 as of 2022-12-10.)
      #
      # On MSYS2, Pip (https://pypi.org/project/pip/) is not installed by default with Python, so we have to explicitly
      # add it.  (In theory, an alternative approach would be to run 'python -m ensurepip --upgrade' which, per
      # https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html, is the official Python way to bootstrap Pip.  However, this
      # did not seem to work properly in MSYS2 when I tried it.)

      #
      # On Windows, there are a couple of extra things we need to do before running the bt script:
      #
      #  - For historical reasons, Linux and other platforms need to run both Python v2 (still used by some bits of
      #    system) and Python v3 (eg that you installed yourself) so there are usually two corresponding Python
      #    executables, python2 and python3.  On Windows there is only whatever Python you installed and it's called
      #    python.exe.  To keep the shebang in the bt script working, we just make a softlink to python called python3.
      #
      #  - Getting Unicode input/output to work is fun.  We should already have a Unicode locale, but it seems we also
      #    need to set PYTHONIOENCODING (see https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONIOENCODING, even
      #    though it seems to imply you don't need to set it on recent versions of Python).
      #
      #  - The version of Pip we install above does not put it in the "right" place.  Specifically it will not be in the
      #    PATH when we run bt.  The following seems to be the least hacky way around this:
      #       curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
      #       python get-pip.py
      #       python -m pip install -U --force-reinstall pip
      #    See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48087004/installing-pip-on-msys for more discussion on this.
