      # Install MSYS2, then Python, then Pip

      # We need Python 3.10 or later to run the bt script
      #
      # I tried using the separate actions/setup-python@v4 action, but it doesn't seem to result in the Python
      # executable being visible in the MSYS2 environment.  So, instead, we install from inside MSYS2.  (According to
      # https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-python, this is Python 3.10.9 as of 2022-12-10.)
      #
      # On MSYS2, Pip (https://pypi.org/project/pip/) is not installed by default with Python, so we have to explicitly
      # add it.  (An alternative approach would be to run 'python -m ensurepip --upgrade' which, per
      # https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html, is the official Python way to bootstrap Pip.)

      # keep the shebang in the bt script working, we just make a softlink to python called python3.
